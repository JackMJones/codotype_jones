<p class="text-muted"><strong>Schemas</strong> describe the data managed by your project.</p>

<p class="text-muted">Think of each <strong>Schema</strong> as a single table in <em>SQL</em>-land (or a single collection in <em>No-SQL</em>-land.)</p>

<p class="text-muted">Your project includes a <strong>User Schema</strong> by default with a single <strong><em>E-Mail</em> attribute</strong> to help you get started. The <strong>User Schema</strong> cannot be removed.</p>
